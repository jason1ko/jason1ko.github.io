<h3>i) Use the Monte Carlo integration with random variables drawn from
the bivariate Gaussian copula (Algorithm A) until the (estimated)
variance of the estimator is less than <span class="math inline">\(10^{−5}\)</span>.</h3>
<p>The idea of algorithm A is as follows: Let the indicator function of
<span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(I
[|\sin(X^3 + Y^2)| &lt; 0.5]\)</span>, be 1 when <span class="math inline">\(|\sin(X^3 + Y^2)|\)</span> is less than 0.5, or 0
otherwise. Then <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb P\left( I [|\sin(X^3
+ Y^2)| &lt; 0.5] = 1 \right ) := p\)</span>, the probability that
should be estimated, is, <span class="math inline">\(p = 1*p + 0*(1-p) =
\mathbb E[I [|\sin(X^3 + Y^2)| &lt; 0.5]]\)</span>. So, by the Law of
Large Numbers (Monte Carlo Integration), the value ‘p’ can be estimated
by <span class="math display">\[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^n I [
|\sin(X_i{^3} + Y_i{^2}) | &lt; 0.5 ] \to \mathbb E[I [|\sin(X^3 + Y^2)|
&lt; 0.5]] = p\\
\text{as } n \to \infty.\]</span></p>
<p>Each <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y_i\)</span> can be expressed by <span class="math inline">\(U_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(U_2\)</span> generated from Gaussian copula <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, whose set <span class="math inline">\((U_{1,i}, U_{2,i})\)</span> is i.i.d for all <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>.</p>
<p>In short, the process of estimating the expectation is as follows.
Generate <span class="math inline">\((U_{1,i}, U_{2,i})\)</span> from
the Gaussian copula <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> independently
for <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, obtain <span class="math inline">\((X_i, Y_i) = \left( F^{-1}(U_{1,i}),
G^{-1}(U_{2,i}) \right)\)</span>that follows <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>, then the expectation can be estimated
by <span class="math display">\[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^n I [
|\sin(X_i{^3} + Y_i{^2}) | &lt; 0.5 ] \to \mathbb E[I [|\sin(X^3 + Y^2)|
&lt; 0.5]].\]</span></p>
<p>Cholesky function is required to generate <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, which is similar to the HW3. So the
‘Chol’ function, the transpose of the built-in ‘chol’ in R, is defined
as follows.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>Chol &lt;- function(mat){
  return(t(chol(mat)))
}</code></pre>
<p>An indicator function is defined to present whether the value <span class="math inline">\(\vert \sin(X^3 + Y^2) \vert\)</span> is less than
0.5, called ‘indicator_gau_cop’. This function needs 4 parameters used
for the parameters of gamma distributions each. This function generates
two random variables from standard normal distributions first (using
‘runif’ function) denoted by z1 and z2, performs Cholesky decomposition
to get the correlated random vectors W, get the CDF values of standard
normal distribution with respect to each element of W, and obtain the x
and y from the inverse of F and G w.r.t the CDF values. For the
generated x and y, the reference value (denoted by ‘ref’) is set to the
<span class="math inline">\(\vert \sin(X^3 + Y^2) \vert\)</span>. If the
‘ref’ is less than 0.5, the indicator variable I is 1, or 0 otherwise,
which is same as <span class="math inline">\(I(\vert \sin(X^3 + Y^2)
\vert )\)</span>. At the end of the function returns the indicator
value.</p>

<p>The main function ‘hw4_q1_1’ to calculate the estimated value ‘p’
(sample mean), sample variance, estimated variance of p, and the number
of iterations is as follows. The estimated value is written as the
sample mean of the indicator value <span class="math inline">\(\bar
X\)</span> from now on. Let <span class="math inline">\(X_n\)</span>be
the nth indicator value, <span class="math inline">\(\bar X_n\)</span>be
sample mean of successive ‘n’ indicators from the beginning, <span class="math inline">\(S_n^2\)</span> be the sample variance of ‘n’
sequential indicators, and <span class="math inline">\(S_n^2/n\)</span>
be the estimated variance of nth sample mean <span class="math inline">\(\bar X_n\)</span> (‘p’). The initial value of
sample mean and sample variance is <span class="math inline">\(\bar X =
X_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(S_1^2 = 0\)</span>. Then,
the general form of <span class="math inline">\(\bar X_n\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(S_n^2\)</span> is as follows (by the
successive computation formula): <span class="math display">\[\bar X_n =
\frac{(n-1)\bar X_{n-1} + X_n}{n},\quad n \ge 2\\
S_n^2 = \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n-1}\right) S_{n-1}^2 + n(\bar X_n - \bar
X_{n-1})^2, \quad n \ge 2.\]</span></p>
<p>The initial values of sample mean and sample variance in the
‘hw4_q1_1’, whose variable names are ‘Xbar’ and ‘Ssq’ respectively, are
the output of the function indicator_gau_cop(3, 1.5, 7.5, 1) and 0 each.
From the next iteration <span class="math inline">\((n \ge 2)\)</span>,
generate the indicator X from indicator_gau_cop function, save the
previous <span class="math inline">\((n-1)\)</span>th values of sample
mean and sample variance to Xbar_prev and Ssq_prev, and calculate the
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>th value of sample mean and sample
variance in accordance with the above formulas. Save the nth sample mean
and sample variance to Xbar_prev and Ssq_prev again, and obtain the
<span class="math inline">\((n+1)\)</span>th value of sample mean and
variance. There is no restriction about the smallest number for the CLT,
so this function does not break the iteration until <span class="math inline">\(n = 30\)</span>. The variance of the estimator
<span class="math inline">\(\bar X_n\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(S_n^2/n\)</span>, so this iteration discontinues
when two conditions <span class="math inline">\(n \ge 30\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(S_n^2/n \le 10^{-5}\)</span> meet. After the
halt of the iteration, save the sample mean, sample variance, the
variance of the sample mean, and the number of iterations in the form of
data frame.</p>

the density of the Gaussian copula. Also, <span class="math inline">\(U_{1,i} = F(X_i)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(U_{2,i} = G(Y_i)\)</span>. So, this is the main
idea of algorithm B to estimate the probability <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb P( I[\vert \sin(X^3 + Y^2) \vert &lt; 0.5]
= 1) = \mathbb E[ I[\vert \sin(X^3 + Y^2) \vert &lt; 0.5] ]\)</span>, in
which <span class="math inline">\(U_{1,i}, U_{2,i}\)</span> are
independent uniform distribution.</p>
<p>Another indicator function ‘indicator_iid_unif’ is defined as
follows. The input is the correlation coefficient <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>. The output itself is not actually
indicator, but the name is nominated as ‘indicator’ to simply correspond
to the previous function. At first, generate 2 independent random
numbers <span class="math inline">\(U_1, U_2\)</span> from uniform
distributions, and carry out inverse of gamma function to the<span class="math inline">\(U_1, U_2\)</span>, denoted by x and y. The
reference value is the absolute value of <span class="math inline">\(\sin (X^3 + Y^2)\)</span>. Then, Set the indicator
variableI is 1 if the reference is less than 0.5, or 0 otherwise.</p>
<p>Given the correlation matrix R and <span class="math inline">\(q =
[\Phi^{-1}(U_1), \hspace{1mm} \Phi^{-1}(U_2)]^{\top}\)</span>, the
density of Gaussian copula is as follows: <span class="math display">\[c(U_1, U_2) =
\frac{1}{\sqrt{|R|}}\exp\left\{-\frac{1}{2}q^{\top}(R^{-1} -
I)q\right\}, \quad I : (2 \times 2) \text{ identity matrix}\]</span></p>
<p>The matrix R is <span class="math inline">\(R = \begin{bmatrix}1
&amp; \rho \\ \rho &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix}\)</span>, and put <span class="math inline">\(\Phi^{-1}(U_1) = a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Phi^{-1}(U_2) = b\)</span> for simplicity. hen
the Gaussian copula density is <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
c(U_1, U_2)
&amp;= \frac{1}{1 - \rho^2}\exp\left\{
-\frac{1}{2}\begin{bmatrix}a&amp;b\end{bmatrix}

<p>The main function ‘hw4_q1_2’ is almost similar to the previous one
‘hw4_q1_1’, except for the fact that an indicator (1 or 0) multiplied by
a copula density is the sample. Accordingly, the <span class="math inline">\(\bar X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(S^2\)</span> are the sample mean and sample
variance of the indicator (1 or 0) multiplied by copula density. Then,
the initial value of ‘Xbar’ and an indicator ‘X’ for every iteration in
the function are the only variables to change. The rest of the code is
identical to the previous function, including the successive
computation. This function also checks whether the variance of the

<div id="indicator-function" class="section level4">
<h4>(6) Indicator function</h4>
<p>Given a fixed time (100 weeks in this case), an indicator function is
defined so that it can output whether the capital remains non-negative
for the period. (Since it requires that the Capital should be always
Non-Negative until , the name of the function is chosen as
‘CNN_indicator’). In this function, all of the parameters (ex. <span class="math inline">\(\mu_A, \lambda_F\)</span>…) and initial values
(ex. <span class="math inline">\(n_{AF}, a\)</span>,…) are determined.
Before getting into the loop, initial time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is set to 0, the rate <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span> is set as the above expression, and
generate the time of the next event based on the rate <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>, nominated as <span class="math inline">\(t_E\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="while-loop" class="section level4">
<h4>(7) While loop</h4>
<p>When the generated time of next event is bigger than the given time
(denoted as ‘T_’), which usually occurs after a significant number of
iterations, the output I is set to ‘1’ and discontinue the loop.</p>
<p>The other case, which is the general case, is when the time of next
event is less than or equal to ‘T_’. Then, increase the amount of asset
a by the number of each policy holder times the premium of each
insurance times the time interval: <span class="math inline">\(a +
(n_Ac_A + n_Fc_F + n_{AF}c_{AF})(t_E - t)\)</span> After then, the
current time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is shifted to the
<span class="math inline">\(t_E\)</span></p>
<p>After resetting the asset and time, the next step is to generate the
type of the next event. To categorize the events in minimum numbers,
there are 9 events: 1) new sign-up for A, 2) new sign-up for F, 3) new
sign-up for AF, 4) termination of A for A holders, 5) termination of A
for AF holders, 6) termination of F for F holders, 7) termination of F
for AF holders, 8) a claim of A, and 9) claim of F. The number inside a
bracket in front of the event name corresponds to the event from now
on.</p>
<p>Each event follows exponential distribution with discrete rate
parameters respectively (the value of parameters are defined in
advance), and the probability that the next event (minimum of the time
of next event) is the specific event is proportional to that rate
parameter (times the number of holders). Then, generating the type of
next event (which will be same as generating integers from 1 to 9) with
different probability will be the next step. So, the probability vector
‘p’ is set for each iteration and insert this to the integer-generating
function, nominated as ‘random_integers’.</p>
<p>The vector ‘p’ has the 9 rate parameters sequentially; <span class="math inline">\(\nu_A, \nu_F, \nu_{AF}, n_A\mu_A, n_{AF}\mu_A,
n_F\mu_F, n_{AF}\mu_F, (n_A + n_{AF}\lambda_A), (n_F +
n_{AF})\lambda_F\)</span>.</p>
<p>If the generated integer J is 1 with prob <span class="math inline">\(\nu_A/z\)</span>, the number of A holders
increases by 1. If the J is 2 with prob <span class="math inline">\(\nu_F/z\)</span> the number of F holders increases
by 1. If the J is 3 with prob <span class="math inline">\(\nu_{AF}/z\)</span> the number of AF holders
increases by 1.</p>
<p>The number J between 4 and 7 covers the case when the policy
terminates. J = 4 occurs with probability <span class="math inline">\(n_A\mu_A/z\)</span>, so the number of A holders
decreases by 1. J = 5 occurs with probability <span class="math inline">\(n_{AF}\mu_A/z\)</span>, so the number of AF
holders decreases by 1 and the number of F holders increases by 1. J = 6
occurs with probability <span class="math inline">\(n_F\mu_F/z\)</span>,
so the number of F holders decreases by 1. J = 7 occurs with probability
<span class="math inline">\(n_{AF}\mu_F/z\)</span>, so the number of AF
holders decreases by 1 and the number of A holders increases by 1.</p>
<p>J = 8 means a claim A occurs, with probability <span class="math inline">\((n_A + n_{AF}\lambda_A)/z\)</span>. Then generate
the amount of claim that follows <span class="math inline">\(Y \sim
\text{Exp}(y_A)\)</span>. If the Y is bigger than the current asset,
make the indicator I be 0 and stop the iteration. Otherwise, decrease
the current asset by the Y. J = 9 means a claim F occurs with
probability <span class="math inline">\((n_F +
n_{AF})\lambda_F\)</span>. Then, generate the amount of claim that
follows <span class="math inline">\(Y \sim \text{Exp}(y_F)\)</span>. If
the Y is bigger than the current asset, let the indicator 𝐼 be 0 and
stop the iteration. Otherwise, decrease the current asset by Y.</p>
<p>After the generation of J and the following action, reset the time of
next event <span class="math inline">\(t_E\)</span> by adding the
current time ‘t’ and the generated new time from <span class="math inline">\(\text{Exp}(z)\)</span>, the parameter ‘z’ of which
is changed by the increase or decrease of each policy holders. Then, it
will go back to the front of the while loop and check whether the t_E is
greater than ‘T_’ again. This iteration will stop until the indicator I
is determined between 1 and 0. If the I is determined, this function
will end by outputting the value.</p>

<div id="estimated-probability" class="section level4">
<h4>(8) Estimated probability</h4>
<p>The final step is to estimate the probability of interest. This
problem requires to repeat the generation of the indicator for 1000
times and to remain the capital non-negative for 100 weeks. So, add all
the 1000 indicators with ‘T_’ = 100 and divide the summation by 1000.
This result is the estimated probability. (The name of this function is
‘hw4_q2’).</p>

<h3>ii) Estimate the probability of interest with 1,000 replications of

<p>As previously mentioned, integers-generating function is needed for
choosing an indicator. N means how many numbers it will return, ‘idx’
means the biggest integer it can generate (the smallest is 1 in this
function), and ‘prob’ is the probability vector, the sum of which should
not be 1 in the input stage. The ith element of the vector means the
integer ‘i’ can be generated in proportion to the ith probability. Using
the inverse transform method, integers-generating function can be made
as follows. After generating U ~ Unif(0,1), it will check in which
region the U is included. If the U is between p[i-1] and p[i] (assume
that p[0] is 0), it will return ‘i’ as an output. The bottom of this
code shows how this function generates random integers from 1 to 4 with
identical probability.</p>
