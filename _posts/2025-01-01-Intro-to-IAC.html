  <h1>Industrial Academic Cooperation Big Data Analysis</h1>

  <p>
    “Industrial Academic Cooperation Big Data Analysis” is a course series offered by the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Yonsei University in collaboration with external institutions and companies. 
    It is designed to give students experience applying what they learn in class to real-world data from fields such as engineering, marketing, and finance, and to derive statistical insights and practical, data-driven solutions.

    In the first course (STA6810), we focused on reviewing fundamental theory, attending invited talks from various companies, and investigating what kinds of statistical perspectives are currently needed in industry. 
    In the second course (STA6850), in addition to industry talks, each team selected a specific domain and carried out a Kaggle project that closely reflected the types of tasks required in that field. 
    In the third course (STA7510), a real marketing company gave a lecture, shared its in-house data, and requested an analysis; students then analyzed the data and proposed ideas back to the company.

    In this blog, I summarize two of the projects in which we conducted full analyses and illustrate the step-by-step process of how we approached and solved the problems.
