  <h1>Data Science Institute</h1>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    The Yonsei University Data Science Institute is a center where graduate students in the Department of Statistics and Data Science provide statistical consulting to graduate students both within and outside Yonsei. 
    When students encounter questions about statistical methodology while writing their theses, the institute helps them clarify their research design and suggests appropriate analytical solutions.

    I participated in this institute as a consulting researcher for one semester. During that time, I handled several consultations, and I have summarized some of the main cases and lessons learned on this blog. 
    Right now, this page serves as the <strong>Introduction</strong> under the <strong>Data Science Institute</strong> category on the left sidebar.
    If you would like to see the specific consulting cases, please read the posts below in order, starting with <strong>Counsel 1</strong>, then <strong>Counsel 2</strong>, and so on.
