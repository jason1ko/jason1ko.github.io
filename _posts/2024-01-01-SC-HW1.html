<h2>Q1. Consider creating a game map of the classic game called
`Minesweeper’ when complete information of mine locations is provided.
Suppose we have an <span class="math inline">\(n \times m\)</span>
binary matrix which shows where mines are located (1 = mine, 0 =
nothing). A game map displays the number of mines in the surrounding 8
pixels at each pixel. Using the following two approaches, write your R
functions that produce a game map when an <span class="math inline">\(n\times m\)</span> binary matrix for the mine
location is given.</h2>

<h3>i) Scan all pixels from (1, 1) to (n, m) using for loops, and check
how many mines are in the surrounding 8 pixels at every location.</h3>
<p>Before creating the for-loop code, a sample matrix is made
(‘sample_mat’) so as to check whether the code works without no
error.</p>

<p>The purpose of this code is to count the number of the mines
surrounding a pixel. The pixel of the input matrix is 1 when there
exists a mine, and 0 otherwise. So, we can obtain the number of mines
around the pixel through extracting a 3*3 matrix whose center is the
very pixel and summing all of the numbers of the 3*3 matrix apart from
the center pixel.</p>
<p>However, this method returns an error without manipulating the input
matrix, because the pixels in the edges can’t count the number of mines
outside the matrix. So, 0 padding should be performed in all of the
edges before counting the mines. Since 0 implies there is no mine in
this area, the zero padding makes sense.</p>
<p>Let us see how the function ‘minesweeper_forloop’ work. The number of
rows and columns are defined as ‘r’ and ‘c’ respectively, and a matrix
‘mat_pad’, which has 2 more columns and rows than the input matrix
‘mat’, is defined by having all of the elements be 0. The reason for
creating ‘mat_pad’ is to add 0’s on every edge of the ‘mat’ matrix.
Then, define another matrix ‘mat_result’ whose size is identical to the
original matrix ‘mat’.</p>
<p>Using a nested for loop, insert each element of ‘mat’ into the
‘mat_pad’ starting from mat_pad[2,2] to mat_pad[r+1, c+1]. Then, the
edges of mat_pad is still 0.</p>
<p>The next step is divided into 2 steps. For one thing, number 99 is
put into the pixel of ‘mat_result’ where a mine exists in the
corresponding pixel of ‘mat’. Second, if the pixel of ‘mat’ is empty
(the number of it is 0), add up all of the surrounding numbers
indicating how many numbers of mine there are and put that number to the
corresponding pixel of ‘mat_result’. These processes are written through
if-else statement in the second nested for-loop.</p>
<p>There is a nested for-loop (3rd) in the else-tatement, working as
counting the surrounding 8 pixels. Inside the loop, another if-else
statement exists so as to avoid the counting of the current pixel. In
this problem, the value of the empty space is 0 so simply adding up all
of the 9 elements of the 3*3 matrix formed by the 3rd nested for-loop
has no problem. However, there should be a case where the number of the
vacant pixel is assigned a non-zero value, such as NAN or NULL. Thus,
the if-tatement containing ‘next’ command is added in order to handle
such cases. After counting all of the surrounding digits, the total
value saved in the ‘temp’ variable is transferred to the corresponding
pixel of ‘mat_result’. At last, the final ‘mat_result’ matrix is
returned.</p>

<p>Take the left picture as an example. When there is a mine (expressed
as a black star) at (2,2) in this example, the number of all the pixels
surrounding the star should rise to 1. In other words, the number of
(3,3) pixel should increase by 1 because of the mine in (2,2), and the
number of (2,1) pixel should increase by 1 as well for the same reason,
and so on. Likewise, one mine affects all of the surrounding 8 spaces.
So, the result of the originally empty pixel is same as that of a matrix
made by adding up all of the 8 matrices which have moved to each 8
directions. Then, insert the number 99 to the mine pixel. At last,
return the matrix whose edges are eliminated (to match the size of the
input matrix).</p>
<p>The number of rows and columns of input matrix is designated as ‘r’
and ‘c’ like the minesweeper_forloop function. As mentioned in the
question, this code does not make use of any for-oop; rather, it will
use ‘rbind’ and ‘cbind’ to move the input matrix and pad it with
zeros.</p>
<p>The following conditions will be assumed in the implementation of the
code; when a matrix is received in the function, it is padded with 0’s
along the edges. Moving the matrix to right is same as adding a row of 0
on the edges of top and bottom side and then adding 2 successive columns
of 0’s on the left side. Moving the matrix to upper right means adding 2
consecutive columns of 0’s on the left side and then add 2 consecutive
rows of 0’s on the bottom side. This methodology is applied to the other
6 directions. Then, define a matrix which is the summation of the 8
matrices. Then, put the number 99 to the pixels corresponding to the
mine pixel. At last, return the matrix, omitting the 4 edges.</p>

<h3>i) Use the fact that the area of a circle of radius 1 is <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>, as shown in the lecture notes. You
need two uniform random numbers for one iteration of simulation.</h3>
<p>In this case, the value of <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>
is approximated based on the following assumptions. Let the (x, y) be a
coordinate in a 2*2 square, and each x and y are independent and
uniformly distributed. Then, the probability that the point is in a
circle of radius 1 is <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>/4. Then,
the number of points inside the circle divided by the number of all the
points in the square is the estimation of <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>/4. So, the value π is estimated by
the estimated probability multiplied by 4.</p>
<p>At first, generate N numbers (the number N is given in the problem)
from the uniform distribution (unif(0,1)) and save it to ‘u1’. After
doing some manipulation, N/2 numbers will be picked up among them. The
reason for assigning N numbers first is to make the ith number of u1 in
this function identical to that of the function of Q2-ii). Perform the
same process and save it to ‘u2’. The ‘u1’ and ‘u2’ are modified as x =
2<em>u1-1 and y = 2</em>u2-1, which still follow uniform distribution
unif(-1,1).</p>
<p>Next, define a zero vector ‘one’ whose length is N/2. When the square
of ith number of x and y returns a value lower than or equal to 1, the
ith value of the ‘one’ vector is shifted to 1. Repeat this process for
N/2 times and add up all of the elements of the ‘one’ vector. After the
summation is divided by N/2, it returns the estimated probability of
being inside the circle. Thus, this estimated probability multiplied by
4 is the estimated <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>.</p>

<h3>ii) Use the fact that the volume of a sphere of radius 1 is 4<span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>/3. You need three uniform random
numbers for one iteration of simulation.</h3>
<p>The key point of the estimation here is almost same as the previous
problem, apart from the fact that it is proceeded in a 3 dimensional
space. Let (x,y,z) be a coordinate of 2<em>2</em>2 cube, and each x,y
and z are independent and uniformly distributed (unif(-1,1)). Then the
probability that the point lies in a sphere of radius 1 is (4<span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>/3)/8 = <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>/6. Then, the number of points inside
the sphere divided by the number of all the points in the cube is the
estimated value of <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>/6. So, the
value π is estimated by the estimated value multiplied by 6.</p>
<p>The logic of ‘pi_sphere’ function that generates the estimated <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> in 3 dimension is almost identical to
that of ‘pi_circle’ function, except for some notations and additional
variables. At first, 3 uniformly distributed variables u1, u2 and u3 is
made (u1, u2, u3 ~ unif(0,1)), whose length is N. Then, change them so
that they still follow uniform distribution (x,y, z ~ unif(-1,1)).
Define an indicator vector ‘one’ with length ‘N/3’ and add 1 to the ith
space if the sum of the square of ith x, y, and z is lower than or equal
to 1. The added value of ‘one’ vector divided by N/3 is the estimated
probability <span class="math inline">\(\pi/6\)</span>, so the estimated

multiplying 6 to the value.</p>
