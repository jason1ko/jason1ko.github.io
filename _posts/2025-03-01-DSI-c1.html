<h1>Client’s Inquiry</h1>
<p>This study aims to examine the effects of indoor office environment
images on stress levels. To achieve this, three spatial variables were
defined: <strong>color</strong> (cool/warm), <strong>ceiling
height</strong> (low/high), and <strong>window view</strong>
(urban/natural).</p>
<p>The experiment consists of two stages (<strong>Test 1</strong> and
<strong>Test 2</strong>) conducted on the same group of 30
participants.</p>
<div id="test-1" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Test 1:</strong></h2>
<p>To investigate the individual effects of each spatial variable,
images representing each condition (a total of 6 images) will be
presented separately.<br />
Paired-sample t-tests will be used to compare stress indices across
conditions in order to determine whether there are significant
differences between them.</p>
</div>
<div id="test-2" class="section level2">
<h2><strong>Test 2:</strong></h2>
<p>In the second stage, combinations of the three variables will be used
to create <strong>2 × 2 × 2 conditions</strong> (color × ceiling height
× view), resulting in a total of 8 image conditions.<br />
Stress levels will be measured under each condition, with <strong>stress
index</strong> as the dependent variable and <strong>environmental
condition (8 combinations)</strong> as the independent variable.<br />
A <strong>One-way Repeated Measures ANOVA</strong> will be conducted to
examine whether there are significant differences in mean stress levels
among the combined environmental conditions.</p>
<p>We would like to ask for your review regarding whether this
statistical design and analysis approach is appropriate, and whether
there might be a simpler or clearer method for analyzing the data.<br />
In particular, we would like to confirm whether the use of
<strong>One-way ANOVA</strong> or <strong>One-way Repeated Measures
ANOVA</strong> is suitable in this case, and whether the sample size of
<strong>30 participants</strong> is sufficient or should be
increased.</p>

<h1>Answer</h1>
<div id="test-1-1" class="section level2">
<h2>1. Test 1</h2>
<div id="section" class="section level3">
<h3>(1)</h3>
<p>The model is given as <span class="math display">\[Y_{ij} = \mu +
\tau_j + s_i + \epsilon_{ij}\]</span> where</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(Y_{ij}\)</span> : ith subject’s stress
figure when exposed to jth condition (color, …)</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> : mean</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\tau_j\)</span> : the effect of color
condition ( Cool colors vs. warm colors)</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(s_i\)</span>​: the effect of subjects
(random effect)</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\epsilon_{ij}\)</span>​: error</li>
</ul>
<p>the way to adjust the significance level (Bonferroni) : <span class="math inline">\(\alpha_B = \alpha/n\)</span> That is: each test is
considered significant only if its p-value is less than <span class="math inline">\(\alpha/n\)</span>. This ensures that the overall
significance level remains at <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-1" class="section level3">
<h3>(2)</h3>
<p>If there are more than 3 levels? =&gt; One-way Repeated Measures
ANOVA. ex) 3 colors.</p>
<p>Idendical model, but the number of <span class="math inline">\(\tau_j\)</span> is 3: <span class="math inline">\(j=1,2,3\)</span>. Then, the null hypothesis is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[H_0 : \tau_1 = \tau_2 =
\tau_3\]</span></p>
<p>If the null hypothesis is rejected, it means that at least one of the
levels has a different effect. The specific levels that differ can be
identified through pairwise t-tests. For instance,</p>
<ul>
<li>cool color vs neutral color</li>
<li>cool color vs warm color</li>
<li>neutral color vs warm color</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, a Bonferroni correction (or similar adjustment) should
be applied.</p>
</div>
<div id="section-2" class="section level3">
<h3>(3)</h3>
<p>We may have the following question : &gt; <em>If we conduct a
Three-way Repeated Measures ANOVA from the start, can we still check the
significance of each factor in the same way?</em></p>
<p>The Three-way RM ANOVA can encompass the t-test results from Test 1,
but it does not guarantee completely identical outcomes. Test 1 is
designed to evaluate each factor in isolation, whereas the Three-way RM
ANOVA analyzes the effect of each factor while all factors act
simultaneously.</p>
<p>If all interaction effects are not significant, the main effects of
each factor can be interpreted independently. In this case, the main
effect results from the Three-way RM ANOVA and the results from
analyzing each factor separately using t-tests can provide practically
similar or even identical conclusions.</p>
<p>However, the main effects in a Three-way RM ANOVA represent the
average effects while controlling for the mean influence of other
factors, whereas t-tests examine the effects with other factors held
constant. Therefore, due to the differences in design and
interpretation, the numerical results may differ.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="test-2-1" class="section level2">
<h2>2. Test 2</h2>
<div id="one-way-rm-anova" class="section level3">
<h3>(1) one-way RM anova</h3>
<p>model : <span class="math display">\[Y_{ij} = \mu + \tau_j + s_i +
\epsilon_{ij}\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\tau_j\)</span> : jth effect (j =
1,…,8)</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(s_i\)</span> : ith subject effect,
random effect</li>
</ul>
<p>Then,</p>
<p>null hypothesis : tau_1 = … = tau_8, alternative hypothesis : At
least one of them has a different stress index.</p>
<p>If the null hypothesis is rejected, post-hoc tests can be used to
determine which conditions differ.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this approach is suitable if the goal is simply to
test whether the three factors have no overall effect. However, it is
not appropriate if you want to understand the individual effects of each
factor or their interaction effects.</p>
</div>
<div id="three-way-rm-anova" class="section level3">
<h3>(2) three-way rm anova</h3>
<p><span class="math display">\[Y_{ijkl} = \mu + color_j + level_k +
view_l + ...  + s_i + \epsilon_{ijkl}\]</span> - <span class="math inline">\(s_i\)</span> : subject effect (random effect)</p>
<p>It also allows you to identify both the main effects of each factor
and the presence of interaction effects. Through this, you can
determine: - whether each factor (e.g., color) has a significant effect,
and - whether there are interaction effects between two or among all
three factors.<br />
(This is done by checking whether p &lt; 0.05 ⇒ significant.)</p>

<h2>3. Better model</h2>
<div id="clients-analysis-objective" class="section level3">
<h3>(1) Client’s Analysis Objective:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>To determine whether each design element (color, ceiling height,
and window view) has an individual effect.</p></li>
<li><p>To see whether stress levels differ depending on the combination
of conditions.</p></li>
<li><p>If possible, to further identify which specific combinations are
particularly effective.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="comparison" class="section level3">
<h3>(2) Comparison:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Interpretability:</strong> One-way RM ANOVA shows only
the mean differences among the 8 conditions,<br />
whereas Three-way RM ANOVA reveals the main effects of color, ceiling
height, and window view, as well as their interaction effects.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Clarity of interpretation:</strong> One-way RM ANOVA
allows statements like “Which combination resulted in lower
stress,”<br />
while Three-way RM ANOVA allows statements such as “What is the average
effect of color on stress.”</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="conclusion-three-way-rm-anova" class="section level3">
<h3>(3) Conclusion: Three-way RM ANOVA</h3>
<p>The client’s main interest is not just in comparing
combinations,<br />
→ but in understanding <strong>how much each design factor (color,
ceiling height, view)</strong> influences stress.</p>
<p>A One-way RM ANOVA only shows whether there are differences among the
8 combinations,<br />
→ but it can never tell whether those differences are due to color,
ceiling height, or their interaction.</p>
<p>In contrast, a Three-way RM ANOVA can analyze<br />
→ the main effects of color, ceiling height, and window view,<br />
→ as well as all possible interaction effects among them.</p>
<p>Given that the core purpose of the experiment is to understand how
these design factors affect stress,<br />
→ the Three-way RM ANOVA is a more suitable approach than the One-way RM
ANOVA.</p>
</div>
<div id="participants" class="section level3">
<h3>4. [30] participants</h3>
<p><strong>Appropriate Minimum Benchmark</strong></p>
<p>When the sample size is around <strong>30 or more</strong>, the
sampling distribution of the mean approximately follows a <strong>normal
distribution</strong>.<br />
→ Therefore, under the assumption of normality, the use of
<strong>t-tests</strong> and <strong>ANOVA</strong> becomes valid.<br />
→ For this reason, <strong>“30 participants”</strong> is widely used as
a practical benchmark in research.</p>
<p>cf) <strong>Advantage of Repeated Measures Design:</strong><br />
It provides <strong>higher statistical power</strong> with a
<strong>smaller sample size</strong> compared to an independent-sample
design.</p>
